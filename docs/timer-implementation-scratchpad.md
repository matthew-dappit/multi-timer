# Timer Implementation Scratchpad
**Date:** October 1, 2025
**Status:** âœ… IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

---

## ðŸŽ‰ Implementation Complete!

The timer logic has been fully implemented with all primary requirements met:

âœ… **Accurate Time Tracking** - Timestamp-based system survives refresh, inactive tabs, browser sleep
âœ… **Single Active Timer** - Only one timer can run at a time
âœ… **Time Event History** - All start/stop events recorded for TimeInsights
âœ… **Timer Metadata** - Project name, task name, and notes captured for each event

### Quick Start Testing

1. **App is running at:** http://localhost:3001
2. **Try it out:**
   - Click "Start" on any timer
   - Watch it count up in real-time
   - Refresh the page - timer continues!
   - Start another timer - first one stops automatically
   - Click "Stop" to end the session
   - Check the daily total at the top

3. **View your data:**
   - Navigate to "Insights" page to see time breakdown
   - Open browser console and check: `localStorage.getItem('multi-timer/time-events')`

---

## Requirements Analysis

### Primary Requirements
1. **Accurate time tracking** - Must survive:
   - Page refresh
   - Inactive browser tabs
   - Browser crash
   - Computer sleep
   - Only stops if cache is cleared
   
2. **Single active timer** - Only 1 timer running at a time

3. **Time event history** - Record start/stop events for TimeInsights page

4. **Timer metadata** - Each timer needs:
   - Project name (from group)
   - Task name
   - Notes

---

## Architecture Design

### Core Principle: Timestamp-Based Tracking
**Why?** Timestamps are immune to browser throttling, tab inactivity, and system sleep.

### Data Structures

```typescript
// Time Event - Immutable record of a timer session
interface TimeEvent {
  id: string;              // Unique event ID
  groupId: string;         // Which project group
  timerId: string;         // Which timer in the group
  projectName: string;     // Snapshot of project name
  taskName: string;        // Snapshot of task name
  notes: string;           // Snapshot of notes
  startTime: number;       // Unix timestamp (ms)
  endTime: number | null;  // null = still running
}

// Running Session - Tracks currently active timer
interface RunningSession {
  timerId: string;         // Which timer is running
  groupId: string;         // Which group it belongs to
  eventId: string;         // ID of the active TimeEvent
  startTime: number;       // When it started (ms)
}

// Timer Data - Extended with elapsed time
interface TimerData {
  id: string;
  taskName: string;
  notes: string;
  elapsed: number;         // Total elapsed seconds (calculated from events)
}
```

### Storage Strategy

```typescript
// localStorage (persistent across sessions)
"multi-timer/state"       // Groups, timers, isCompact
"multi-timer/time-events" // Array of TimeEvent[]

// sessionStorage (cleared on browser close)
"multi-timer/running"     // RunningSession | null
```

**Why sessionStorage for running timer?**
- If browser crashes, we want the timer to stop
- If user closes browser, timer should stop
- If user refreshes, timer should continue (sessionStorage persists)

---

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Timer Logic âœ“

1. **Add TimeEvent and RunningSession interfaces**
2. **Add elapsed field to TimerData**
3. **Create time calculation function**
   - `calculateElapsedFromEvents(timerId, events, runningSession)`
   - Sum all completed events for this timer
   - Add current running time if this timer is active
4. **Add storage keys and state management**

### Phase 2: Timer Controls âœ“

1. **Start Timer Function**
   - Stop any currently running timer
   - Create new TimeEvent with startTime
   - Save to time-events array
   - Create RunningSession
   - Save to sessionStorage
   
2. **Stop Timer Function**
   - Find active TimeEvent
   - Set endTime to now
   - Update time-events array
   - Clear RunningSession
   - Clear sessionStorage

3. **Update Timer Component**
   - Add start/stop button logic
   - Add active state visual indicators
   - Pass callbacks from MultiTimer

### Phase 3: Real-time Updates âœ“

1. **Add interval effect**
   - Run every 1 second
   - Recalculate elapsed for active timer
   - Update display
   
2. **Hydration on mount**
   - Load time-events from localStorage
   - Load running session from sessionStorage
   - Validate running session (check if stale)
   - Resume timer if valid

### Phase 4: Daily Total & Insights Integration âœ“

1. **Calculate daily total**
   - Filter events for today
   - Sum all elapsed times
   - Display in header

2. **Ensure TimeInsights compatibility**
   - Verify TimeEvent structure matches
   - Test data flow

## Key Implementation Details

### Time Calculation Algorithm

```typescript
function calculateElapsedFromEvents(
  timerId: string,
  events: TimeEvent[],
  runningSession: RunningSession | null
): number {
  // Sum all completed events for this timer
  const completedTime = events
    .filter(e => e.timerId === timerId && e.endTime !== null)
    .reduce((sum, e) => sum + (e.endTime! - e.startTime), 0);
  
  // Add current running time if this timer is active
  let runningTime = 0;
  if (runningSession?.timerId === timerId) {
    runningTime = Date.now() - runningSession.startTime;
  }
  
  // Convert ms to seconds
  return Math.floor((completedTime + runningTime) / 1000);
}
```

### Start Timer Flow

```
User clicks Start
  â†“
Stop any running timer (if exists)
  â†“
Create TimeEvent {
  id: generateId(),
  timerId: timer.id,
  groupId: group.id,
  projectName: group.projectName,
  taskName: timer.taskName,
  notes: timer.notes,
  startTime: Date.now(),
  endTime: null
}
  â†“
Add to timeEvents array
  â†“
Save to localStorage
  â†“
Create RunningSession {
  timerId: timer.id,
  groupId: group.id,
  eventId: event.id,
  startTime: Date.now()
}
  â†“
Save to sessionStorage
  â†“
Start interval to update display
```

### Stop Timer Flow

```
User clicks Stop
  â†“
Find active TimeEvent (endTime === null)
  â†“
Set endTime = Date.now()
  â†“
Update timeEvents array
  â†“
Save to localStorage
  â†“
Clear RunningSession
  â†“
Clear sessionStorage
  â†“
Recalculate final elapsed time
```

### Hydration Flow (on page load)

```
Component mounts
  â†“
Load timeEvents from localStorage
  â†“
Load runningSession from sessionStorage
  â†“
If runningSession exists:
  â†“
  Validate: is the timer still in our groups?
  â†“
  If valid: resume timer display
  â†“
  If invalid: clear session, close event
  â†“
Start interval for real-time updates
```

   - All time calculations based on Unix timestamps (milliseconds)
   - Immune to browser throttling, tab inactivity, and system sleep
   - Accurate to the second

2. **TimeEvent System**
   - Immutable records of timer sessions
   - Stores: id, groupId, timerId, projectName, taskName, notes, startTime, endTime
   - Persisted to localStorage (`multi-timer/time-events`)
   - Filtered to today's events on load

3. **RunningSession Tracking**
   - Tracks currently active timer
   - Persisted to sessionStorage (`multi-timer/running`)
   - Cleared on browser close (intentional - timer should stop)
   - Validated on hydration (checks if timer still exists)

4. **Single Active Timer Constraint**
   - Starting a timer automatically stops any running timer
   - Only one timer can be active at a time
   - Visual indicators show which timer is running

5. **Real-Time Updates**
   - Interval runs every 1 second when a timer is active
   - Recalculates elapsed time from timestamps
   - Updates display without drift

6. **Data Persistence**

### Testing Instructions

#### Manual Testing Checklist

1. **Basic Functionality**
   - [ ] Click Start on a timer - it should start counting
   - [ ] Click Stop on a running timer - it should stop
   - [ ] Time displays in HH:MM:SS format
   - [ ] Daily total updates when timers run

2. **Single Timer Constraint**
   - [ ] Start Timer A
   - [ ] Start Timer B - Timer A should stop automatically
   - [ ] Only Timer B should show as running

3. **Accuracy Tests**
   - [ ] Start a timer, wait 10 seconds, stop it - should show ~00:00:10
   - [ ] Start a timer, refresh the page - timer should continue running
   - [ ] Start a timer, switch to another tab for 30 seconds - timer should continue
   - [ ] Start a timer, minimize browser for 1 minute - timer should continue

4. **Persistence Tests**
   - [ ] Start a timer, refresh page - timer should still be running
   - [ ] Stop a timer, refresh page - elapsed time should be preserved
   - [ ] Close browser, reopen - timer should be stopped (sessionStorage cleared)
   - [ ] Clear cache - all data should be gone

5. **Edge Cases**
   - [ ] Start a timer, delete that timer - should stop gracefully
   - [ ] Start a timer, delete the group - should stop gracefully
   - [ ] Create multiple timers, start/stop different ones - elapsed times should be independent
   - [ ] Start timer with empty task name - should work
   - [ ] Edit task name while timer is running - should continue running

6. **TimeInsights Integration**
   - [ ] Run a timer for a few minutes, stop it
   - [ ] Navigate to Insights page
   - [ ] Event should appear in hourly breakdown
   - [ ] Project should appear in project summary
   - [ ] Time should match what was tracked

7. **UI/UX Tests**
   - [ ] Active timer shows teal border and ring
   - [ ] Status indicator shows "Running" with teal dot when active
   - [ ] Status indicator shows "Idle" with gray dot when inactive
   - [ ] Start button is turquoise
   - [ ] Stop button is coral
   - [ ] Compact mode: clicking card starts/stops timer
   - [ ] Daily total updates in real-time

#### Browser Console Tests

```javascript
// Check localStorage
localStorage.getItem('multi-timer/time-events')
localStorage.getItem('multi-timer/state')

// Check sessionStorage
sessionStorage.getItem('multi-timer/running')

// Clear all data
localStorage.removeItem('multi-timer/time-events')
localStorage.removeItem('multi-timer/state')
sessionStorage.removeItem('multi-timer/running')
```

## Notes & Decisions

1. **Why not use intervals for timing?**
   - Browsers throttle intervals in inactive tabs
   - Can drift over time
   - Not reliable for accurate time tracking

2. **Why sessionStorage for running timer?**
   - Persists across refresh (good)
   - Clears on browser close (good - timer should stop)
   - Clears on crash (good - timer should stop)

3. **Why store snapshots of project/task names?**
   - User might rename project after timer runs
   - Historical data should reflect what it was at the time
   - Enables accurate reporting

4. **Why calculate elapsed on every render?**
   - Source of truth is timestamps, not a counter
   - Ensures accuracy even after long periods
   - Minimal performance impact
