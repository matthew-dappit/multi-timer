## Quick Overview

### What is Multi-Timer?

Multi-Timer is a web application designed for development agencies to track billable hours across multiple projects and tasks simultaneously. It features:

- ⏱️ **Event-Based Time Tracking** - Accurate to the second, immune to browser throttling
- 📁 **Project Organization** - Group timers by project or client
- � **Visual Analytics** - Hourly heatmaps and project breakdowns
- �💾 **Persistent State** - Never lose your time data
- 🔐 **User Authentication** - Secure user accounts with Xano backend
- � **Complete History** - Audit trail of all work sessions

### Key Concepts

#### Time Event System
Instead of simple counters, Multi-Timer stores timestamp events:

```typescript
{
  startTime: 1696176000000,  // When timer started
  endTime: 1696179600000     // When timer stopped (or null if running)
}
```

This approach provides:
- Perfect accuracy regardless of browser state
- Complete audit trail for billing
- Foundation for analytics and reporting

#### Project Groups
Organize timers into groups representing projects or clients:

```
Client A
├── Feature Development (2h 34m)
├── Code Review (45m)
└── Meetings (1h 15m)

Client B
├── Bug Fixes (1h 20m)
└── Consultation (30m)
```

## Project Context

### The Problem
Dappit, a 6-developer agency, bills clients hourly. Developers need to:
- Track time across multiple concurrent projects
- Switch between tasks without losing time
- Have accurate records for billing
- Never lose data due to browser issues

### The Solution
A single-page web app with:
1. Multiple simultaneous timers (only one running at a time)
2. Daily total showing all tracked time
3. Complete timestamp history for billing accuracy
4. Robust persistence (survives refreshes, crashes, etc.)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Modern web browser
- Xano account (for authentication)

### Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/matthew-dappit/multi-timer.git

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your Xano credentials

# Run development server
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the app.

See [Quick Start Guide](./quick-start.md) for detailed instructions.
