## Overview

This document tracks the iterative process of integrating the multi-timer application with Xano backend services. The integration will be implemented **one function at a time**, with thorough documentation of each step, decisions made, and lessons learned.

### Purpose
- Replace localStorage-only persistence with Xano database backend
- Enable cross-device timer synchronization
- Provide reliable data backup and recovery
- Support multi-user collaboration features (future)

### Approach
- **Incremental Integration:** Implement one function at a time to minimize risk
- **Parallel Operation:** Maintain localStorage functionality during transition
- **Thorough Testing:** Validate each function before moving to the next
- **Complete Documentation:** Capture all decisions, code changes, and test results

## Current Implementation

### How Timers Currently Work

#### Timer Lifecycle

**Starting a Timer:**
1. User clicks "Start" button on a specific timer in `Timer.tsx`
2. `handleStartTimer(groupId, timerId)` is called in `MultiTimer.tsx`
3. System checks if another timer is running (only one timer can run at a time)
4. If another timer is running, it's stopped automatically
5. A new `TimeEvent` record is created with:
   - Unique `id` (UUID)
   - `timerId` and `groupId` references
   - `startTime` (ISO timestamp)
   - `startSnapshot` (timer metadata: taskId, taskName, projectId, projectName, notes)
6. A `RunningSession` is created in sessionStorage:
   ```typescript
   {
     timerId: string
     groupId: string
     eventId: string
     startTime: string (ISO)
   }
   ```
7. The timer displays live elapsed time, updating every second

**Stopping a Timer:**
1. User clicks "Stop" button or starts another timer
2. `handleStopTimer()` is called
3. The corresponding `TimeEvent` record is updated with:
   - `endTime` (ISO timestamp)
   - `endSnapshot` (current timer metadata at stop time)
4. Elapsed time is calculated: `endTime - startTime`
5. `RunningSession` is cleared from sessionStorage
6. Timer display shows total elapsed time (static)

#### Data Storage

**localStorage Keys:**
```typescript
// Main application state
'multi-timer/state' = {
  groups: TimerGroup[]        // All timer groups and their timers
  compactView: boolean
  activeTab: string
}

// Complete time tracking history
'multi-timer/time-events' = TimeEvent[]

// Current running timer session (synced to sessionStorage)
'multi-timer/running' = RunningSession | null

// Authentication
'multi-timer-auth-token' = string (JWT)
'multi-timer-user' = { name: string, email: string }
```

**Data Structures:**

```typescript
// Timer hierarchy: Group ‚Üí Timer ‚Üí TimeEvents
interface TimerGroup {
  id: string              // UUID
  projectId: string       // Zoho CRM Project ID
  projectName: string     // Display name
  timers: TimerData[]     // Child timers (tasks)
}

interface TimerData {
  id: string              // UUID
  taskId: string          // Zoho CRM Task ID
  taskName: string        // Display name
  notes: string           // User notes
  elapsed: number         // Total seconds (calculated from TimeEvents)
}

interface TimeEvent {
  id: string              // UUID
  timerId: string         // Reference to TimerData
  groupId: string         // Reference to TimerGroup
  startTime: string       // ISO timestamp
  endTime?: string        // ISO timestamp (undefined if running)
  startSnapshot: {        // Metadata at start time
    taskId: string
    taskName: string
    projectId: string
    projectName: string
    notes: string
  }
  endSnapshot?: {         // Metadata at end time (if changed)
    taskId: string
    taskName: string
    projectId: string
    projectName: string
    notes: string
  }
}

interface RunningSession {
  timerId: string
  groupId: string
  eventId: string         // TimeEvent being recorded
  startTime: string       // ISO timestamp
}
```

### Current Data Management

#### Projects and Tasks Storage

**Projects (Timer Groups):**
- Loaded from Zoho CRM via `/api/tasks` endpoint
- Cached in localStorage under `multi-timer/state.groups[]`
- Each project becomes a `TimerGroup` with a unique `id`
- Projects contain nested arrays of timers (tasks)

**Tasks (Timers):**
- Loaded from Zoho CRM as children of projects
- Each task becomes a `TimerData` within its parent `TimerGroup`
- Tasks store: `taskId`, `taskName`, `notes`, `elapsed` time

**Notes:**
- Stored directly in `TimerData.notes` field
- Captured in `TimeEvent` snapshots for historical context
- User-editable through the timer interface
- Preserved across timer start/stop cycles

#### Time Events Storage

**Storage Location:** `localStorage['multi-timer/time-events']`

**Structure:**
- Flat array of all `TimeEvent` records
- Each record is immutable once created (endTime set)
- Running events have `endTime: undefined`
- Events include metadata snapshots for data integrity

**Calculation Pattern:**
- On mount: Load all events from localStorage
- Filter events by `timerId`
- Calculate total elapsed: `sum(endTime - startTime)` for all completed events
- Update timer's `elapsed` property
- Recalculate on any time event change (create, update, delete)

**Key Features:**
- Complete audit trail of all time tracking
- Support for editing past time entries
- Manual time entry without running timer
- Date-grouped history view
- Snapshots preserve historical context even if task/project renamed

## Integration Goals

### Phase 1: Core CRUD Operations
- [ ] Create time events in Xano when timer starts
- [ ] Update time events in Xano when timer stops

### Phase 2: Project/Task Sync
- [ ] Store projects (timer groups) in Xano
- [ ] Store tasks (timers) in Xano
- [ ] Sync notes between local and Xano
- [ ] Handle Zoho CRM integration with Xano storage

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- [ ] Real-time synchronization across devices
- [ ] Conflict resolution for concurrent edits
- [ ] Offline support with sync on reconnect
- [ ] Data migration tools

### Success Criteria
- ‚úÖ No data loss during integration
- ‚úÖ localStorage continues to work as fallback
- ‚úÖ Sub-second latency for timer operations
- ‚úÖ Complete audit trail maintained
- ‚úÖ All existing features continue to function

## Notes & Decisions

### Key Decisions Log

This section captures important architectural and implementation decisions.

**[Date] - Initial Setup Decision:**
- Chose to maintain localStorage as primary source during transition
- Xano will be secondary store initially, with gradual promotion to primary
- This allows safe rollback if issues arise
