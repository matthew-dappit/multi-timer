## [2.0.0] - October 1, 2025 (Deprecated)

### ðŸŽ‰ Major Update: Event-Based Time Tracking (Old System - Now Removed)

#### Fixed
- **Timer Accuracy Issue** - Timers now show accurate elapsed time
  - Previous issue: Timer showed 4:43 when real time was 20:06
  - Root cause: `startedAt` timestamp was being reset every second
  - Solution: Implemented event-based time tracking using timestamps

#### Added
- **Time Event System**
  - Store start/stop timestamps for each timer session
  - Calculate elapsed time from actual timestamps
  - Immune to browser throttling and inactive tabs
  - Complete audit trail for billing accuracy
  
- **Event History**
  - All timer sessions stored as time events
  - Foundation for analytics and reporting
  - Can reconstruct any timer's complete history
  
#### Changed
- **Timer Component** - Simplified to pure presentation
  - Removed internal interval and time calculation logic
  - Now receives elapsed time from parent component
  - Cleaner, more maintainable code

- **MultiTimer Component** - Enhanced state management
  - Added `timeEvents` state for storing session history
  - Recalculates elapsed time from events every second
  - Automatic cleanup of old events (keeps only today's data)

- **Storage Schema**
  - Added `multi-timer/time-events` localStorage key
  - Events filtered to current day on load
  - Prevents unbounded data growth

#### Technical Details
```typescript
// New TimeEvent interface
interface TimeEvent {
  id: string;
  groupId: string;
  timerId: string;
  startTime: number;       // Timestamp when started
````
  endTime: number | null;  // Timestamp when stopped (null if running)
  taskName: string;
  projectName: string;
}
```

## Upgrade Guide

### Upgrading to 2.0.0 from 1.x

The event-based time tracking system is **backward compatible**. Your existing timers will continue to work:

1. Old `elapsed` values are preserved
2. First time a timer starts, it creates its first TimeEvent
3. Subsequent starts/stops use the new event system
4. No data migration required

**What You'll Notice:**
- Timer accuracy improves dramatically
- Time tracking works correctly in inactive tabs
- LocalStorage includes new `multi-timer/time-events` key

**Optional Cleanup:**
If you want to start fresh with the new system:
```javascript
// Clear old data (optional)
localStorage.removeItem('multi-timer/state');
localStorage.removeItem('multi-timer/time-events');
sessionStorage.removeItem('multi-timer/running');
```
