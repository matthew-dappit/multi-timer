# Multi-Timer

## Context

The six developers at Dappit software development agency bill client work based on hourly rates. This requires tracking time across multiple projects and tasks throughout the day. Having a simple and elegant multi-timer web app with multiple stopwatches for different tasks will be hugely beneficial.

## MVP Requirements

1. Stopwatches work seamlessly: starting or resuming a certain watch pauses all other ones.
2. A central number shows how much time Iâ€™ve done for the day, which is the sum of the active watches.
3. The app keeps a history of timestamps when watches were started and stopped, so I can have a breakdown of what I did and when.
4. If I lose internet connection or close the browser, it keeps the progress. If I lose the watches, I lose my billing time for the day. This is another reason why point 3 is important (to store a cache of times stopped and started).

## Future Features

1. Integrate with ClickUp, Linear, or any other project management software to pull tasks in for the day that can give names to the watches.
2. Potentially sync with Zoho Books to make logging the hours easier at the end of the day.

## Architecture & Components

### Component Structure
```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ app/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ page.tsx          # Main homepage with header and MultiTimer
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layout.tsx        # Root layout with Poppins font
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ globals.css       # Global styles and Tailwind imports
â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Timer.tsx         # Individual timer component
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ MultiTimer.tsx    # Timer management and daily total
```

### Timer.tsx
**Purpose**: Individual stopwatch component with project tracking
**Key Features**:
- Real-time HH:MM:SS timer display
- Project name dropdown (Dappit Internal, Client Projects, Marketing, etc.)
- Task name dropdown (Development, Code Review, Testing, etc.)
- Notes textarea for work details
- Billable checkbox (default: checked)
- START/STOP button with color-coded states
- Visual status indicator (running/stopped)

**Props**:
- `id`: Unique timer identifier
- `onStart`: Callback when timer starts
- `onStop`: Callback when timer stops  
- `isActive`: Boolean indicating if this timer is the active one

### MultiTimer.tsx
**Purpose**: Manages multiple Timer components and enforces exclusive operation
**Key Features**:
- Daily total time display (sum of all timers)
- Add/remove timer functionality
- Ensures only one timer runs at a time
- Responsive grid layout for multiple timers
- User instructions and guidance

**State Management**:
- `timers`: Array of timer data objects
- `activeTimerId`: ID of currently running timer
- `totalDailyTime`: Cumulative time across all timers

### Component Interaction Flow
1. **User starts Timer A**: `Timer.tsx` calls `onStart(id)` â†’ `MultiTimer.tsx` sets `activeTimerId`
2. **User starts Timer B**: `MultiTimer.tsx` automatically sets Timer A's `isActive` to false
3. **Timer A stops**: React effect in `Timer.tsx` detects `!isActive` and stops the timer
4. **Timer B becomes active**: Only Timer B continues counting

### Technical Implementation Details

**Timer State Management**:
- Each Timer component maintains its own time state using `useState`
- Timer counting uses `setInterval` with 1-second increments
- React `useEffect` hooks manage timer lifecycle and cleanup

**Exclusive Operation Logic**:
- MultiTimer maintains `activeTimerId` state
- When a timer starts, MultiTimer sets `activeTimerId` to that timer's ID
- All other timers receive `isActive: false` and automatically stop
- Only the active timer's interval continues running

**UI/UX Features**:
- Color-coded buttons: Turquoise (#01D9B5) for START, Coral (#FF7F50) for STOP
- Visual status indicators with colored dots
- Responsive design with CSS Grid for multiple timers
- Dark/light mode support with proper contrast
- Inline styles used for custom Dappit colors to ensure visibility

**Form Data Structure**:
```typescript
interface TimerData {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  // Future: projectName, taskName, notes, billable, timeEntries
}
```

## MVP Status

### âœ… Completed Requirements
1. **Exclusive timer operation**: âœ… Starting any timer pauses all others
2. **Daily total display**: âœ… Central display shows cumulative time
3. **Project/task tracking**: âœ… Dropdown fields for organization
4. **Professional design**: âœ… Dappit brand colors and responsive layout

### ðŸ”„ In Progress Requirements
