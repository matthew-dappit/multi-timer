# Multi-Timer

## Context

The six developers at Dappit software development agency bill client work based on hourly rates. This requires tracking time across multiple projects and tasks throughout the day. Having a simple and elegant multi-timer web app with multiple stopwatches for different tasks will be hugely beneficial.

## MVP Requirements

1. Stopwatches work seamlessly: starting or resuming a certain watch pauses all other ones.
2. A central number shows how much time Iâ€™ve done for the day, which is the sum of the active watches.
3. The app keeps a history of timestamps when watches were started and stopped, so I can have a breakdown of what I did and when.
4. If I lose internet connection or close the browser, it keeps the progress. If I lose the watches, I lose my billing time for the day. This is another reason why point 3 is important (to store a cache of times stopped and started).

## Future Features

1. Integrate with ClickUp, Linear, or any other project management software to pull tasks in for the day that can give names to the watches.
2. Potentially sync with Zoho Books to make logging the hours easier at the end of the day.

## Architecture & Components

### Component Structure
```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ app/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ page.tsx          # Home route rendering the multi-timer dashboard
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layout.tsx        # Root layout with Poppins font and shared shell
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ globals.css       # Global styles and Tailwind imports
â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Navbar.tsx        # Branded navigation bar shared across pages
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Timer.tsx         # Individual timer component
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ MultiTimer.tsx    # Timer management and daily total
```

### Timer.tsx
**Purpose**: Individual stopwatch card that adapts between full and compact views.
**Key Features**:
- Real-time HH:MM:SS display (elapsed time controlled by `MultiTimer`)
- Standard view: task input, notes textarea, and start/stop CTA
- Compact view: clickable card showing elapsed time and notes label only
- Active timer highlights with turquoise ring and coral stop state

**Props**:
- `id`: Unique timer identifier
- `elapsed`: Elapsed time in seconds
- `taskName`, `notes`: Controlled text inputs from parent
- `isCompact`: Switches between card layouts
- `onElapsedChange`, `onTaskChange`, `onNotesChange`
- `onStart`, `onStop`, `isActive`

### MultiTimer.tsx
**Purpose**: Group-based timer manager with compact toggle and daily summary.
**Key Features**:
- Daily total display with dense compact variant
- Project groups containing multiple timers
- Add/remove project groups and timers
- Compact toggle that tightens spacing and switches timer cards
- Responsive grid supporting high timer counts per row

**State Management**:
- `groups`: Array of project objects `{id, projectName, timers[]}`
- `activeTimerId`: Tracks which timer is currently running
- `isCompact`: Global toggle for compact presentation

### Layout.tsx & Navbar.tsx
**Purpose**: Supply the shared application chrome, typography, and navigation.
**Key Features**:
- Applies the Poppins font globally and wraps all pages with the branded background shell
- Renders `<Navbar />` above page content so every route shares the same header
- Navbar swaps between light and dark logos and links back to `/` when the logo is clicked

### Component Interaction Flow
1. **User starts Timer A**: `Timer.tsx` calls `onStart(id)` â†’ `MultiTimer.tsx` sets `activeTimerId`
2. **User starts Timer B**: `MultiTimer.tsx` automatically sets Timer A's `isActive` to false
3. **Timer A stops**: React effect in `Timer.tsx` detects `!isActive` and stops the timer
4. **Timer B becomes active**: Only Timer B continues counting
5. **Timer increments**: Each second, `Timer.tsx` calls `onElapsedChange(id, newElapsed)` to update the parent, which updates the timer's `elapsed` value in state.
6. **Today's Total**: `MultiTimer.tsx` always displays the sum of all timers' `elapsed` values, live-updating as timers run.

### Technical Implementation Details

**Timer State Management**:
- All timer elapsed time state is managed in the parent `MultiTimer` component.
- Each Timer receives its `elapsed` value and a callback to update it from the parent.
- Timer counting uses `setInterval` in the child, but updates the parent state every second.
- React `useEffect` hooks manage timer lifecycle and cleanup.

**Exclusive Operation Logic**:
- MultiTimer maintains `activeTimerId` state
- When a timer starts, MultiTimer sets `activeTimerId` to that timer's ID
- All other timers receive `isActive: false` and automatically stop
- Only the active timer's interval continues running

**UI/UX Features**:
- Color-coded buttons: Turquoise (#01D9B5) for START, Coral (#FF7F50) for STOP
- Visual status indicators with colored dots
- Responsive design with CSS Grid for multiple timers
- Dark/light mode support with proper contrast
- Inline styles used for custom Dappit colors to ensure visibility

**Data Structures**:
```typescript
interface TimerData {
  id: string;
  taskName: string;
  notes: string;
  elapsed: number;
}

interface TimerGroup {
  id: string;
  projectName: string;
  timers: TimerData[];
}
```
